</p><p class="section-e"><b>3.11.8.1. Recirculation Systems</b></p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (1) </b>Every <i>public pool</i> shall be equipped with a <i>recirculation system</i>.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (2) </b>For the purposes of this Subsection, the water in a <i>public pool</i> and its <i>recirculation system</i> is deemed not to be <i>potable</i> water.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (3) </b>The water in a <i>public pool</i> and its <i>recirculation system</i> shall be separated from the <i>potable</i> water supply and from the sewer or drainage system into which it drains by <i>air gaps</i> or other devices that prevent,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) the water in the pool or its <i>recirculation system</i> from flowing back into the <i>potable</i> water supply, and</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) the water in the sewer or <i>drainage system</i> from flowing back into the pool or its <i>recirculation system</i>.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (4) </b>The <i>recirculation system</i> of a <i>public pool</i> shall be designed, constructed and equipped to comply with Sentences (5) to (20).</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (5) </b>The <i>recirculation system</i> of a <i>public pool</i> shall be capable of filtering, disinfecting and passing through the pool each day a volume of water of at least,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) in the case of a Class A pool, other than a <i>modified pool</i> or a <i>wave action pool</i>, six times the total water volume of the pool,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) in the case of a Class B pool, other than a <i>wave action pool</i>, four times the total water volume of the pool,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (c) in the case of a <i>modified pool</i>, three times the total water volume of the pool, and</p> <p class="clause-e">  (d) in the case of a <i>wave action pool</i>, six times the total water volume of the pool.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (6) </b>A <i>recirculation system</i> shall be equipped with a flow meter registering the rate of water flow.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (7) </b>All pools shall be provided with automatic <i>make-up water</i> devices and provided with water meters to register the volume of all <i>make-up water</i> added to a <i>public pool</i> or its <i>recirculation system</i>.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (8) </b>Equipment shall be installed to continuously disinfect the water in a <i>public pool</i> by means of,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) a chlorination or hypochlorination system provided with a chemical controller for regulating the dosage of chlorine and capable of providing not less than,</p> <p class="subclause-e">  (i) in the case of an <i>door pool</i>, other than a <i>wave action pool</i>, 300 g of chlorine per day per 10 000 L of total pool capacity,</p> <p

in the case of an door <i>wave action pool</i>, 1 200 g of chlorine per day per 10 000 L of total pool capacity, and</p> <p class="subclause-e">  (iv) in the case of an indoor <i>wave action pool</i>, 800 g of chlorine per day per 10 000 L of total pool capacity, or</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) a bromination system capable of maintaining in the pool water a total bromine residual of 3 mg/L.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (9) </b>Chlorination equipment for a <i>public pool</i>shall contain a mechanism whereby the chlorine feed shall automatically terminate whenever the <i>recirculation system</i> ceases to supply <i>clean water</i> to the pool.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (10) </b>All exposed <i>potable</i> water piping and chlorine piping within a <i>public pool</i> water treatment <i>service room</i> shall be colour coded by means of,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) painting the entire outer surface of the piping, or</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) coloured bands at least 25 mm in width that are spaced along the piping at intervals of not more than 1 200 mm.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (11) </b>The colour coding referred to in Sentence (10) shall be yellow for chlorine and green for <i>potable</i> water.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (12) </b>Except for a <i>modified pool</i> and <i>wave action pool</i>, a <i>public pool</i>shall be equipped with overflow gutters or surface skimmers connected to the <i>recirculation system</i> that are capable of removing surface film from the surface of the water and withdrawing each day and discharging to the waste drains up to 15% of the total volume of pool water.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (13) </b>A <i>public pool</i> shall be equipped with <i>clean water</i> inlets arranged in conjunction with surface skimmers or overflow gutters to provide uniform distribution and circulation of<i>clean water</i>.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (14) </b>Except as permitted in Sentence (19), all fittings at or below the water surface that allow water and/or air to be passed to or from the <i>public pool</i> shall,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) have a maximum opening of 7 mm in one direction, and</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) be securely held in place by corrosion resistance fastening that require a tool for removal and are galvanically compatible with the fittings and grilles or covers.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (15) </b>Except as provided in Sentence 3.11.6.1.(7) for a <i>modified pool</i>, all fittings below the water surface that provide suction or gravity flow in a <i>public pool</i>shall,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) be provided with a minimum of two suction or gravity outlets interconnected to a full size manifold, and</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) be separated by a clear distance of not less than 1 200 mm.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (16) </b>Except as provided in Sentence 3.11.6.1.(7) for a <i>modified pool</i>, water in all <i>public

sources of suction flow are present at one time, and</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) be such that every suction fitting located within 1 000 mm of the water surface, except for skimmers and gutter fittings, contain openings with a minimum aggregate area of 0.2 m<sup>2</sup>.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (18) </b>Except for skimmers and gutters, all submerged suction and gravity fittings shall be clearly and permanently marked with a 50 mm wide band in a contrasting colour.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (19) </b>Fittings returning water and/or air to the pool tank that are located within 300 mm of the water surface are permitted to have openings with one dimension more than 7 mm but shall contain no openings more than 25 mm in diameter.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (20)
