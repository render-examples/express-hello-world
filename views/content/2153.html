Heat Recovery ventilators</b></p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(1) </b>Where a heat recovery ventilator is installed to provide all or part of the requirements of this Subsection, this Article shall apply.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(2) </b>Heat recovery ventilators shall be designed to provide a minimum 55% sensible heat recovery efficiency when tested to the low temperature thermal and ventilation performance test method set out in CAN/CSA-C439, "Rating the Performance of Heat/Energy-Recovery ventilators", at a Station 1 test temperature of –25°C at an air flow not less than 30 L/s.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(3) </b>Where a heat recovery ventilator is connected to a forced air heating system, the supply side of the ventilator shall be directly connected to the return air side of the forced air heating system.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(4) </b>Two or more heat recovery ventilators shall not be connected in parallel air flow to a common air <i>supply duct</i> unless specifically recommended by the manufacturer.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(5) </b>Two or more heat recovery ventilators shall not be connected in parallel air flow to a common downstream <i>exhaust duct</i>.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(6) </b>Heat recovery ventilators installed in unheated spaces shall be installed so as to avoid condensation of moisture on fans and motors in exhaust air, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(7) </b>All start-up procedures recommended by the manufacturer including air balancing and air-flow determination shall be followed.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(8) </b>Free flow of condensate shall be provided in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations or, in their absence, a condensate drain of minimum ½ inch nominal pipe size pitched in the direction of flow and complete with a trap or condensate pump with sufficient capacity shall be installed.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(9) </b>The heat recovery ventilator and all condensate lines shall be installed in a space where the ambient temperature will not adversely affect the operation of the system.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(10) </b>When operating at the rate required in Article 9.32.3.4., the supply and exhaust airflow rates of the heat recovery ventilator shall be balanced so that the value of the lesser flow shall be at least 90% of the value of the greater flow, unless otherwise recommended by the manufacturer.</p>
